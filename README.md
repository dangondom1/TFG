## Introduction

This Project stands for a end-of-degree Project by Daniel González Domínguez. The purpose of this work is the instantiation of two management strategies for energy communities, one based in linear programming optimization strategies, and the other one based in game-theory based optimization strategies.

Grid sell prices -> https://www.naturgy.es/hogar/solar/tarifa_solar

## Corollaries

1. The p2p energy market price is calculed by the following expression: p2p_price = (Grid_buy_price+Grid_sell_price)/2.

2. Grid sell price is assumed constant.
